Naglang is a minimalist programming language implemented in C based on Toby Ho's [Small Lang](https://github.com/airportyh/smallang).


## Open Questions for Development
- Will this project have utf-8 support? This would include normalizing characters, refusing to compile a file with potentially malicious characters, etc.
- How will error handling work?
