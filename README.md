# Not A Good Language

Naglang is a minimalist programming language implemented in C based on Toby Ho's [Small Lang](https://github.com/airportyh/smallang). Currently this program is only a transpiler to Python (>= 3.8).

Potential plans for this project include supporting JavaScript as a compilation target and creating an interpreter.


## Open Questions for Development
- Will this project have utf-8 support? This would include normalizing characters, refusing to compile a file with potentially malicious characters, etc.
- How will error handling work?
- Will this project be dropped almost immediately now that it's in a minimum working state?
